# work-day-scheduler

## Description
In building this application, first I focused on Bootstrap Grid to create my time block elements. This required editing custom Css and applying existing css rules to my columns or rows. Then I began with Javascript and Jquery. Using moment.js I displayed the current date at the top of the page. Next I focused on the editing elements and setting/geting the saved data. Lastly, I incorporated the color change by  using moment.js and a jquery each statement.
